# Toon Tanks
 This game was made by with the help of the course Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games by GameDev.tv Team. With the collaboration of Epic Games.
 
 This is a course game so I wanted to add a mechanic of my own. I added a power up mechanic where power up turrets are dropped when an enemy is destroyed. This will give bonuses like health and speed.
